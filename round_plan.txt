Round 1:
	no items
	no actions
	one bullet
	two health

Round 2:
	just showcase action

Round 3:
	just showcase items

round 4:
	maybe 1 round of complete round cycle


item_coffee:
	completely re-spin the cylinder

action_breathe:
	ends your turn and FORCES enemy.target to be you, then increases your health by 1, makes gun.damage += 1 for one turn
	[might be able to sync with possible future reflect damage item or something]

action_bangGun:
	if there's not bullet in the chamber, doubles damage, if there is, it fires at you

item_gunpowder:
	adds 1 damage to the gun but skips two turns if you shoot yourself with an empty chamber

for item_gunpowder:
	to have the enemy turn skip twice, have:
	1. enemy.takeTurn = True
	2. if gunpowderSkipCount <2:
		enemy.takeTurn = False
	3a. if gunpowderSkipCount <2:
		gunpowderSkipCount += 1
	3b. gunpowderSkipCount += 1
	you set gunpowderSkipCount to 0 when you use gunpowder and there's no bullet
	you choose either 3a or 3b, 3b will keep the counter going, which I don't think there's wrong with but you never know

maybe have a chance for "gun to break" and force the gun to reload. the idea is for it to somewhat solve the problem of it always having just the amount of chambers minus the amount bullets, now we got some chance.

item_coin:
	select a character and there's a fifty fifty chance the character either loses their turn or is ensured to have their turn

action_forceLoad:
	if no bullet in chamber, add a bullet, if there is, fire at last player target chosen

action_shiver:
	lose two of your turns, makes enemy.target=enemy on the first lost turn,
