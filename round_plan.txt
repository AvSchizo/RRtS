item_coffee:
    completely re-spin the cylinder

action_breathe:
    skips your turn and FORCES enemy.target to be you, then increases your health but, doubles your damage taken for one turn 
    [might be able to sync with possible future reflect damage item or something]

action_bangGun:
    if there's not bullet in the chamber, you add one, if there is, it fires at you

item_gunpowder:
    adds 1 damage to the gun but skips two turns if you shoot yourself with an empty chamber

maybe have a chance for "gun to break" and force the gun to reload. the idea is for it to somewhat solve the problem of it always having just the amount of chambers minus the amount bullets, now we got some chance.

item_coin:
    select a character and there's a fifty fifty chance the character either loses their turn or is ensured to have their turn
