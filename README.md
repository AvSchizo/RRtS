This is a remake of basically a really bad buckshot roulette fangame I did like a year ago, I spent quite a bit of time on it but I didn't really finish anything before I started adding something new.
Also, as long as you don't copy and paste it and claim it as your own, I couldn't care less what you do with it, I'm not sure why you'd want to do that anyway.

A readme test.
